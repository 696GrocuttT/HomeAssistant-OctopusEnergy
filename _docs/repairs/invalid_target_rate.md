# Repairs - Invalid Target Rate

If you receive this error, it means that one or more of your target rate sensors have gone into an invalid state. This can happen for a number of reasons

1. More validation has been added, which your target rate sensor(s) are in violation of or
2. You have switched tariffs and so your target rate sensor(s) are looking in a timeframe that is not possible.

To solve this

1. Go to [your integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integration/?domain=octopus_energy)
2. Click configure against the target rate sensor that is in violation
3. Update the config and save your changes
