# [3.0.0](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/compare/v2.0.0...v3.0.0) (2021-12-22)


### Bug Fixes

* **sensor:** Removed code for falling back on fixed tariffs if no agreement is found ([9a5045b](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/9a5045bca5746e6fb289dda1616f795716e9fad1))


### Features

* **sensor:** Added sensors for accumulative cost of gas for the previous day ([42a1408](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/42a140827a4fc03694a5cc2d1fcaea31010003b5))
* **sensor:** Created coordinator for retrieving current reading and created initial electricity consumption cost ([4f09269](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/4f092694a7a53040b2364ffb6cc74cbf8a6cff57))
* **sensor:** removed current consumption sensors due to insufficient data provided by Octopus Energy ([0470ff3](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/0470ff38c88f1bc480bbe949fed05f4bf16bf57b))
* **sensor:** Removed registering of current consumption sensors ([d263a68](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/d263a6889d907506c6f797329e18c7ac14377b75))
* **sensor:** Updated previous day consumption to only be valid if enough data points are available ([9e71ef2](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/9e71ef28481cd5074ae0a1c4281c4e4166d87d0e))
* **sensor:** Updated previous day cost sensor to include breakdown and standing charges ([6618246](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/66182462a8d23cde7ce745ddfcb3543e7920fe68))
* updated docs ([dff4d16](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/dff4d16895025799364fd0ab00815c95e87150d8))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* We no longer fall back to fixed rate agreements if an active agreement can't be found. This was
added by mistake when people were not receiving sensors when they had moved home and therefore an
inactive house was being picked up. This means that some sensors may disapper, but these should just
be inactive meters.
* **sensor:** Latest consumption sensors are no longer available, which may cause issues anywhere they are used.

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/compare/v1.2.0...v2.0.0) (2021-11-10)


### Bug Fixes

* **api-client:** fixed get_account to find the first property that hasn't been moved out of ([970a7a5](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/970a7a58bdb00504b2c922d6e0a4632e71d9a17f))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **api-client:** This change could cause the sensors associated with your meters to change, as they may have been
associated with a property you had moved out of

# [1.2.0](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/compare/v1.1.0...v1.2.0) (2021-10-30)


### Bug Fixes

* Updated how we determine if we're on an expired fixed tariff ([075766f](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/075766f3ece1a021c889ab0032cd807c028e9300))


### Features

* Updated to move to variable tariffs if a meter's latest agreement was fixed term ([37ee143](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/37ee143737458ec3ead08d43bfb6b2cfed8680cc))
